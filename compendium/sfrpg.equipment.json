Essentially, your need to eat, drink, and breathe is temporarily &ldquo;paused&rdquo; while the acclimation torc continues to hold a charge. You can breathe normally in vacuums, clouds of smoke, water, and thick, thin, and toxic atmospheres, though you aren&rsquo;t protected against the damage of a corrosive atmosphere. In addition, you don&rsquo;t need to worry about starvation or thirst while your acclimation torc is active. Unlike the normal protections provided by most suits of armor, an acclimation torc doesn&rsquo;t grant you protection against low levels of radiation or conditions of cold and heat. An acclimation torc holds 50 charges and uses 1 charge per hour.

			"description": "<p>This handheld holographic display unit has an underslung rack housing dozens of miniaturized flying microbots. When you activate the autocartographer, you pick a grid intersection within 50 feet to which you have line of effect. The microbots scatter in a 100-foot cube, scanning the environment and sending data back to the display unit for aggregation and analysis. The microbots transmit the dimensions and basic layout of rooms, corridors, and sizable natural features, including large furnishings. Their sensors ignore living creatures, fine details (such as images on computer screens), and temporary magical effects, but they record permanent ones, including illusory obstacles. They can&rsquo;t differentiate between illusions or holograms and real objects. The microbots&rsquo; data is sent by a wireless signal and is therefore vulnerable to countermeasures such as signal jammers.<br /><br />Individual microbots are small enough to pass through any opening at least an inch wide. They can operate both in air or vacuum, but heavy gravity or strong or stronger winds overwhelm their delicate propulsion systems and render them inactive. The microbots emit a distinctive whir and can be detected with a successful DC 15 Perception check.<br /><br />One minute after you release the microbots, the autocartographer displays a composite map showing all features within the scanned 100-foot cube as a three-dimensional holographic image, and the microbots return to the unit. You can save these images in a data file that can be displayed later, although you need to rescan an area to obtain updated information, such as opened doors or repositioned furniture. Each file is tagged with global or astronomical positioning data, allowing you to connect multiple maps in space and scroll between them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong>100;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong>10/hour</p>"

			"description": "<p>This small, rectangular box is approximately the size of a handheld computer, with a nondescript carbon-fiber housing attached to an external chip interface that can be plugged into the computers of most starships. A blabbersponder&rsquo;s case is filled with a compact array of microsensors (often composed of inubrix) connected to a miniaturized computer (treat as a tier 0 computer equipped with a control module) that, bolstered by a signal booster, analyzes and actively transmits a starship&rsquo;s vital data to another source. While no astute starship captain would ever install a blabbersponder on their own ship, such devices are often sold in gray markets to saboteurs serving the whims of corporations, or bounty hunters who wish to gain vital information about a specific starship&rsquo;s defenses. Some clever pirates of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora} are also rumored to sell blabbersponders to gullible spacefarers by offering them as upgrades to starship communication systems. They then use the data they collect from the device to determine if the cargo, defenses, weapons, and crew aboard the ship warrant the effort of intercepting and ambushing it later.<br /><br />To install a blabbersponder on a starship computer, you must succeed at an Engineering check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 &times; the starship&rsquo;s tier). Once installed and activated, the blabbersponder&rsquo;s internal computer uses its control module to automatically hack into the computer it&rsquo;s attached to. The control module reads and broadcasts all data related to the starship&rsquo;s systems, allowing any science officer aboard another starship within passive sensor range of the blabbersponder&rsquo;s ship to use the scan action on that vessel, even if the two ships aren&rsquo;t engaged in starship combat. Because of the detailed information provided by the blabbersponder, the science officer performing this scan action gains a +5 circumstance bonus to the associated Computers check, and the broadcasting ship doesn&rsquo;t add the bonus from its defensive countermeasures to the DC.<br /><br />Detecting that a blabbersponder is in fact an instrument of sabotage and not a benign technological device before it is installed requires a successful DC 25 Engineering or DC 30 Perception check. Discovering an installed blabbersponder aboard a starship requires a successful DC 28 Computers check. When an installed blabbersponder&rsquo;s battery is depleted, it recharges itself using the starship&rsquo;s power core in a process that takes about 5 minutes; on the day this occurs, you receive a +2 circumstance bonus to the Computers check to notice the sudden, short surge in power use and discover the blabbersponder on your vessel. Once discovered, a blabbersponder can be easily unplugged.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong>40;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong>1/day</p>"

A ring of brassy metal, an alloy of djezet and mithral, surrounds this hole on the mask&rsquo;s outside. The mask counts as a worn magic item unless you install it in armor, taking up one upgrade slot.<br /><br />As a standard action while wearing the mask, you can forcefully inhale. If you do so, creatures that need to breathe within a 30-foot-radius spread of you must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude saving throw or become short of breath, rendering them fatigued for 1 minute. You can exclude any number of creatures from this effect. @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.WP7hddXW4mLXXXOg]{Environmental protections} offer no benefit against this effect. A target @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.33ynSbmexuxC3cAQ]{Exhausted} by the mask can attempt a saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending that condition on itself if successful. A target that succeeds at such a save still remains fatigued for the full duration.<br /><br />Once you use this item, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you take a 10-minute rest during which you could regain Stamina Points. If you use any&nbsp;breath-stealer mask, you can&rsquo;t use another for the same period. If you try to use any&nbsp;breath-stealer mask&nbsp;more than three times per day, the mask targets you and every breathing creature it can within range of its power. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to activate the mask without being subjected to these limitations, but you can spend no more than 2 Resolve Points per day to activate any&nbsp;breath-stealer mask.</p>"

As a full action, you can connect the&nbsp;creator capsule&nbsp;wirelessly to your comm unit or computer, then command it to print one or more nonmagical personal or technological items. Printing an item requires you to have the plans on the connected device or an infosphere connection through which you can download the blueprints.<br /><br />A&nbsp;creator capsule&nbsp;takes 1 round to create an item, plus 1 round per bulk of the item above light. No individual printed item can have a bulk greater than 3. The&nbsp;creator capsule&nbsp;consumes itself during the printing process. Although the printer can be stopped as a move action, doing so renders the capsule useless for further printing. An item printed by the&nbsp;creator capsule&nbsp;is of average quality, and it has the statistics of an ordinary item of its type.<br /><br />Based on its type, a creator capsule has the following cost and level limits on items it creates.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Combined cost up to 19,000 credits; item level no higher than 10</strong></p>"

You choose the triggering method when setting the detonator. A detonator detonates its payload only if it is within 500 feet, but some detonators can make use of signal-boosting technologies at the risk of becoming vulnerable to countermeasures like signal jammers and other effects.

Dimensional comm units are a kishalee version of the comm units commonly found in the Pact Worlds, but they function using the remnants of the vast demiplane network utilized by the now extinct kishalee civilization. The advantage of dimensional comm units is that their text and verbal communications are instantaneous, whether in the same system or through interstellar space, but because of the degraded state of the kishalee dimensional network, they work only sporadically. Prior to use, a dimensional comm unit must be linked with at least one other unit&mdash;a process that takes only a minute when all units to be linked are on the same planet. Dimensional comm units nearly always work when used on the same planet to reach other linked devices. Over greater distances, each time a dimensional comm is used, there is a 50% chance that it will function properly if used in the same system or a 25% chance if the communication is interstellar (this is rolled in secret by the GM), but only with linked dimensional comm units. If two linked dimensional comm units make a connection, they retain that connection for 24 hours. If the dimensional comm units don&rsquo;t manage to connect, the users can try again after 24 hours.

The display is attached seamlessly to a cylindrical clockwork engine the approximate size and weight of a fire extinguisher, containing myriad ancient-looking cogs and gears incongruously integrated with more modern parts. A series of tuning forks of varying lengths, which protrude from the top of the apparatus, move when a large mechanical crank affixed to one side is operated. Three times per day as a standard action, you can aim the device at a single creature within 30 feet and turn the crank clockwise five full turns; this requires the use of two hands. This causes the&nbsp;dimensional modulator&rsquo;s&nbsp;engine to generate bright flashes of energy, the symbols on its display to change rapidly, and the tuning forks to spin, rise, and fall, emanating an eerie tone. The target must then succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or be immediately transformed into a two-dimensional creature for 1d4 rounds. If the target succeeds at the saving throw, there is a 50% chance that you are affected by the dimensional modulator instead. You must attempt the same saving throw, but if you fail, you are transformed for 1d6 rounds instead.<br /><br />Any creature that becomes two-dimensional in this way is perfectly flat and thin as paper, as if the creature is an animated painting or living shadow.

If a creature dies while two-dimensional, their image is etched permanently onto the flat surface where they perished.<br /><br />Some believe the aliens who created the&nbsp;dimensional modulators&nbsp;are still alive today, having transformed themselves into creatures perceived in more dimensions than most denizens of the Pact Worlds can comprehend.</p>"

			"description": "<h1>Dining</h1>\n<p>Options for dining out can be divided into two broad categories: chain restaurants and independent venues. Chain restaurants are ubiquitous and tend to be cheaper, but they have less variety and the food is lower quality. Independent venues are more expensive, but they often employ master chefs who create the highest-quality food in all the Pact Worlds. The prices listed in Table 1&ndash;33 are averages, and the quality of the restaurant corresponds to the quality of the meals served. Dining at independent venues with well-known or famous chefs can be even more expensive, with prices equal to the head chef&rsquo;s total skill bonus in Life Science multiplied by 10.</p>\n<h2>Pact Worlds Cuisines</h2>\n<p>Many Pact Worlds species have unique culinary trends. These ethnic cuisines show the breadth of options available in the Pact Worlds and do not affect the price of food or meals.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kasathas: Kasathan recipes are usually traditional and exclusively use plants and animals native to their original home world of Kasath. Kasathan cuisine has a decidedly alien appearance that many other species find disturbing, though most dishes are surprisingly savory and delectable.</li>\n<li>Lashuntas: Lashuntas delight in using local flora and fauna in their cuisine, emphasizing the use of native berries, fruits, and nuts to make delightfully palatable dishes. Lashuntas consume a variety of animal products, but arthropod meat&mdash;especially from giant insects&mdash;is most common. According to some old stories, lashuntas adopted this custom as an insult to their ancient enemies on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}, the insectile formians.</li>\n<li>Shirrens: While artfully prepared, traditional shirren cuisine is almost always served raw, accompanied by honeys and nectars as both drinks and sauces for other dishes. Shirrens also eat meat in addition to vegetarian fare, though they prefer vermin and other lower life-forms, consumed still living and moving. To many shirrens, food is yet another choice in which they can express their individualism, and they are more than willing to experiment with other foods, often incorporating elements of other cuisines into their cooking.</li>\n<li>Vesk: Vesk food tends to be pragmatic and utilitarian, as if every dish were handcrafted by a drill sergeant who didn&rsquo;t care much for cooking. The exception to this rule is meat, which any self-respecting vesk agrees is the most crucial component of any meal. Vesk treat preparing and seasoning meat as an art, assimilating and enhancing each new world&rsquo;s recipes for cooking meat almost as quickly as they conquer them.</li>\n<li>@Compendium[sfrpg.races.PWjnNkCCW5diAQU4]{Ysoki}: The fact that ysoki will eat whatever they can get their paws on is largely reflected in their cooking. @Compendium[sfrpg.races.PWjnNkCCW5diAQU4]{Ysoki} fare tends to be scavenged meats and cheeses served either as finger foods or in stews, and the food is often questionable in color, quality, and texture. Many other species tend to avoid eating ysoki cuisine if they can help it.</li>\n</ul>"

Most mule drones resemble metallic quadrupeds with overlarge hooves. A mule drone acts as the combat drone of a 1st-level mechanic, except it has the riding saddle and speed mods instead of the combat drone&rsquo;s normal initial mods. Any Small or smaller creature can ride your mule drone, and the mule drone can be customized to support a specific Medium creature (normally you, if you are Medium); refitting the riding saddle to accommodate a different Medium creature takes 1 day and 100 UPBs. Its skill unit is Athletics. A mule drone has 18 bulk.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Elite Mule Drone (Level 10): An elite mule drone has the jump jets mod. In addition, as a full action, a drone can reconfigure its riding saddle to serve as a mount for any Medium or smaller creature.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physician Drone - Level 4</h2>\n<p>This Small drone is designed to provide basic medical services and nursing. Resembling a mechanical spider with four gripping feet and four arms tipped with syringes, antiseptic applicators, and biogel dispensers, a physician drone usually perches above its patient&rsquo;s bed and provides assistance from above. A physician drone acts as the stealth drone of a 1st-level mechanic, except it has the climbing claws and manipulator arms mods instead of the stealth drone&rsquo;s normal initial mods, and it treats Medicine as a class skill in which it has a single rank. Its skill unit is Acrobatics, and it has an Intelligence of 8 rather than 6. A physician drone has 6 bulk.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Elite Physician Drone (Level 10): An elite physician drone also has the medical subroutine mod, allowing it to provide emergency medical treatment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Porter Drone - Level 4</h2>\n<p>This sturdy Medium drone is designed to haul loads and assist with laborious tasks. Most porter drones resemble stout humanoids with large treaded wheels at the ends of two thick legs and a smooth faceplate with two optical sensors as their only facial features. A porter drone acts as the combat drone of a 1st-level mechanic, except it has the cargo rack and manipulator arms mods instead of the combat drone&rsquo;s normal initial mods. Its skill unit is Perception. A porter drone has 20 bulk.</p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Elite Porter Drone (Level 10): An elite porter drone has the resistance mod, providing it resistance 10 to an energy type of your choice when you purchase it. This choice is usually dependent upon the environment in which the drone is intended to function, such as resistance to fire for a porter drone working in a foundry.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<h2>Valet Drone - Level 4</h2>\n<ul>\n<ul>This Small drone is designed to aid in clothing selection, grooming, and light personal administrative tasks. A valet drone can speak the language it understands, though most valet drones are poor conversationalists and speak only to remind you of social obligations. A valet drone acts as the stealth drone of a 1st-level mechanic, except it has the manipulator arms mod and tool arm mod (containing an integrated hygiene kit and oversized mirror) instead of the stealth drone&rsquo;s normal initial mods. Its skill unit is Perception. A valet drone has 6 bulk.\n<ul>\n<li>Elite Valet Drone (Level 10): An elite valet drone treats Culture as a class skill in which it has a single rank, it can attempt Culture checks to recall knowledge, and it has an Intelligence of 8 rather than 6. Elite valet drones tend to be chatty, and they can spend 10 minutes to adjust your fashion and appearance as necessary for a specific social situation, granting a +2 insight bonus to Diplomacy checks to change a creature&rsquo;s attitude in that situation.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity </strong>100;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong>1/hour</p>"

The visor looks like a pair of virtual reality goggles marked by glowing magical runes. A domination visor must be programmed or reprogrammed by someone trained in both Computers and Mysticism in a process requiring 1 day of work. The visor requires a full action to put on, and the subject must be helpless, @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.lf8pbezocjYIvR9y]{Unconscious}, or willing.<br />Once donned, a domination visor plays its program over the course of 1 minute, during which time the subject is exposed to a potent, magically augmented virtual reality that subtly reprograms their conscious mind. The subject must succeed at a DC 24 Will save or be subject to an effect similar to dominate person, obeying whatever instructions have been programmed into the visor. A domination visor can be removed with a move action; if the domination visor is removed at any time during the 1 minute required for its program to complete, the dominate person effect fails. The commands implanted by a domination visor last for 24 hours, after which the effect ends. No new orders or commands can be given, and if the target is forced to take actions against its nature, it gets a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. The subject can&rsquo;t carry out self-destructive orders. A domination visor can be used only once per day.</p>"

Traditionally, the ceramic is created from soil constituents from the wearer&rsquo;s home world, and the anklets are a way to carry a piece of that home. (The rarest&nbsp;earthbound anklets&nbsp;contain clay from lost Golarion.) Pragmatically, through quantum entanglement and magical means, earthbound anklets provide you a connection to normal gravity.<br /><br />While you wear&nbsp;earthbound anklets, you can activate or deactivate them as a standard action. Wearing the active anklets allows you to act as if you&rsquo;re in standard gravity, ignoring the perils of high gravity and the benefits of low gravity. In zero gravity, you decide a gravitational up and down when you activate the anklets, changing this orientation as a move action. Activating the anklets in zero-g allows you to end the off-kilter condition as part of the same action, and you can then move relative to your subjective up and down as if you were walking on a solid surface.<br /><br />This standard-gravity effect applies only to you and to objects you hold or wear. If an object, such as a thrown weapon, leaves your possession, it is subjected to the gravity of your environment rather than that provided by the anklets.<br /><br />The anklets can remain active for up to 1 hour per day. This usage need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. Once you benefit from a given set of&nbsp;earthbound anklets, you can&rsquo;t benefit from a different set for 24 hours.</p>"

			"description": "<p>Crafted of chemicals found on sweltering jungle worlds, this dull-brown cylindrical unit is no larger than a datapad. When an evenfire unit is activated, an electric current causes the chemicals to emit steady heat, but not light, within a 30-foot radius. Over 1 minute, the temperature of this area increases by 60&deg; F, to a maximum of 80&deg; F. The effects of multiple active evenfire units do not stack. This heat dissipates once the unit is shut off. An evenfire&rsquo;s heat is consistent throughout the area and is no hotter closer to the unit than at the edge of its area of effect. Anyone in the heated area gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves against environmental cold dangers. In moderate or strong winds, an evenfire&rsquo;s temperature increase is reduced to 30&deg; F, and the circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves is reduced to +1.<br /><br />In severe or stronger winds, an evenfire unit provides no temperature increase or save bonus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong>20;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong>2/hour</p>"

If not for conservation efforts on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}, tashtaris could have been hunted to extinction, since their photosensitive adaptations are difficult and expensive to duplicate through synthetic means. Cessation of hostilities between the formians and lashuntas has allowed a recent surge in the regulated trade of biotech that incorporates tashtari tissue. Explorers and scouts equip themselves with focusing membranes or filament mesh, and many people throughout the Pact Worlds use photoenergetic nodes for practical and cosmetic purposes.</p>\n<h2>Focusing Membrane</h2>\n<p>The biological tissue a tashtari uses to produce its muzzle beam, a focusing membrane must be installed as part of an optical laser cybernetic augmentation (AR pg. 89) of its item level or higher, adding to that augmentation&rsquo;s cost but allowing two augmentations in one system. An optical laser modified with a focusing membrane treats a target&rsquo;s fire resistance as if it were 5 lower (10 lower for mk 2). This benefit does not apply to the laser&rsquo;s burn critical hit effect.</p>"

You must have the absorb&nbsp;force graft augmentation (page 140) to take advantage of this augmentation, which allows you to manipulate the same energy. The force you absorb into your free hands with the absorb force graft now lasts for 6 rounds. As a standard action during that time, you can throw a magic missile (as the spell of the same name; 1d4+1 damage with the force descriptor) from each hand that has absorbed a missile, to a maximum of two missiles per round, expending the energy. You can throw additional force bolts from each hand that has absorbed a magic missile (maximum of two additional bolts per round), also expending that energy.</p>"

If the force field&rsquo;s temporary Hit Points are reduced to 0, it is inactive until the end of your next turn, when its fast healing restores some of its Hit Points. The charge capacity, amount of temporary Hit Points granted, and rate of fast healing vary according to the force field&rsquo;s color code. A force field has a usage of 1 charge per round.</p>\n<p>More powerful force fields also have a fortification ability, which gives a percentage chance that a critical hit is treated as a normal attack, dealing normal damage and not applying any critical effect. You roll your fortification percentage chance before the critical hit&rsquo;s damage is rolled. If a force field is inactive, its fortification ability does not function. A suit of armor cannot support more than one force field upgrade.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>COLOR</th>\n<th>CAPACITY</th>\n<th>TEMP HP</th>\n<th>FAST HEALING</th>\n<th>FORTIFICATION</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brown</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>0%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Purple</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>0%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Black</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>0%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>White</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>0%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gray</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>0%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Green</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>25</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>20%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Red</td>\n<td>40</td>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>40%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Blue</td>\n<td>40</td>\n<td>35</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>60%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Orange</td>\n<td>40</td>\n<td>40</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>80%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Prismatic</td>\n<td>100</td>\n<td>50</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>100%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"

The cable line can instead be threaded through the grappler, which takes 1 minute but adds the cable line&rsquo;s hardness and HP to the hardness and HP of the grappler (and vice versa). A grappler has clamps that can slide from its base along a cable line attached to it, allowing it to be climbed as easily as a knotted rope (see Athletics on page 136).<br /><br />You can attach a grappler through which a cable line is threaded to an immobile object that&rsquo;s at least 5 feet in width with a ranged attack against AC 5. If the grappler is fired at a moving object or a smaller object, you must hit that object&rsquo;s KAC + 8 to attach the grappler to the object. After it&rsquo;s attached, the grappler remains anchored until either you give a release command as a move action, the grappler is pried free with an Athletics check equal to the attack roll you made to attach it, or the grappler is destroyed. If a cable line attached to or threaded through a grappler is destroyed but the grappler itself was not damaged, the cable line is destroyed, but the grappler is unharmed. In this case, the grappler loses the excess hardness and HP that a threaded cable line added to it.<br /><br />You can also target a creature with the grappler. This is resolved as a grapple combat maneuver, but a creature struck with the grappler can still use its hands, and its movement is only restricted to remain within range of the length of the grappler&rsquo;s cable. In addition to the normal rules for escaping a grapple, the target can pry itself loose with a successful Athletics check (DC equal to your attack roll to grapple the target). Or, it can perform a sunder combat maneuver (see page 246) against the grappler. Even if the combat maneuver doesn&rsquo;t destroy the attached cable, the creature escapes the grapple.<br /><br />A grappler can be thrown as a grenade or set over the muzzle of a ranged weapon that targets KAC, in which case it has half the normal range increment of the weapon, and you use any weapon proficiency and bonuses to attack you have with that weapon. A grappler can be reused.</p>"

The product’s launch was disastrous, and users logged hundreds of complaints about the knives’ needless complexity.

You wear the scanner on your head or headwear, wirelessly connected to your comm unit or eyewear. The assistant counts as a worn magic item unless you install it in your armor, taking up one upgrade slot.<br /><br />As a move action while wearing the assistant, you can cause the device to magically ping an area within a 60-foot spherical spread of you. Using this ping, the software creates a 3D reconstruction of the area, which it psychically projects to you and all creatures you consider allies in the affected area. This image adjusts to show each creature where it is in the image. The ping doesn&rsquo;t sense through most objects, but it can sense through a closed door or window that isn&rsquo;t airtight, hidden, or otherwise sealed. However, any starmetal in the structure of the door or window blocks this benefit. The ping can detect creatures and objects beyond your line of sight and places them as features on the map. Images of such creatures and objects are sometimes distorted, especially if they&rsquo;re in motion.<br /><br />The&nbsp;infiltration assistant&nbsp;grants you and your allies in its area a +5 insight bonus to Perception checks to locate hidden creatures and doors within the mapped area. The bonus to find creatures applies only so long as those creatures remain in the same place.<br /><br />Creatures with ranks in Mysticism perceive the ping like a barely audible sound that raises goose bumps, and they can attempt a DC 25 Mysticism check to determine that something magical just happened. A creature concentrating on&nbsp;detect magic&nbsp;can sense the ping as a brief flash of magic, and a creature benefitting from&nbsp;arcane sight&nbsp;can see the ping as a literal flash of divination magic.<br /><br />An&nbsp;infiltration assistant&nbsp;can send out 10 pings per day. Each psychic image it produces lasts 5 rounds. As a move action, you can save the image on your comm unit or a similar device for later reference. This static image can provide you a map of the pinged area later without needing to ping it again, but it provides no bonus to Perception checks.<br /><br />Using the assistant creates magical resonance in creatures that benefit from it. Any creature that benefits from more than 10 pings in a given day experiences visual anomalies, becoming @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.YjE6UGzwOTfO9p4g]{Dazzled} until after an uninterrupted 8-hour rest.</p>"

			"description": "<p>An accessory of bone-like plastic worn on the body near the brain, a&nbsp;memory crypt&nbsp;uses magical microcircuitry to keep an ongoing record of your experiences and monitor your vital signs. A&nbsp;memory crypt&nbsp;must be worn for 24 hours to adapt to your neurophysiology. During this time, it records nothing, but thereafter, it records your memories and experiences. After the item adapts to you, you can set a passcode to prevent those who don&rsquo;t know the word or phrase you set from activating the device. A hacker can bypass the password with a successful DC 30 Computers check.<br /><br />If you remove the&nbsp;memory crypt&nbsp;or die, the item stops recording, though it preserves the record of your personality and vitals up to that point. Someone who has the&nbsp;memory crypt&nbsp;can activate it as a standard action. Doing so displays a hologram of you in a form called a memory ghost. This &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; can answer up to six questions. Its knowledge is limited to what you knew up to the point the record in the&nbsp;memory crypt&nbsp;ends, including the languages you spoke.<br /><br />Your ghost answers and converses with creatures as you would, with the attitudes you hold. If you trust the creature asking questions, the memory ghost answers truthfully and helpfully. Otherwise, the ghost can refuse to answer questions or attempt to deceive the questioner using your Bluff skill. A creature can attempt a Computers check to hack the memory crypt to erase it or force your memory ghost to answer questions truthfully. The DC to erase the memory crypt is 20 + your Bluff bonus or your level or CR, whichever is higher. The DC to force your memory ghost to answer is 5 higher. If a&nbsp;memory crypt&nbsp;is erased before being used to question the memory ghost it contains, it can be reused. Additionally, a&nbsp;memory crypt&nbsp;that contains an intact memory ghost can be used as the representation required for casting&nbsp;@Compendium[sfrpg.spells.IRUPIVT101SvIK6l]{Raise Dead}&nbsp;or the monument required for&nbsp;reincarnate. If used in this way to successfully cast either spell, the&nbsp;memory crypt&nbsp;is consumed. Once a&nbsp;memory crypt&nbsp;is activated, the memory ghost remains for 10 minutes or until it answers six questions. Magic powers the circuitry to replicate brain patterns. These patterns are disrupted if another power source is patched into the item in an attempt to prolong the memory ghost. When the duration ends, the&nbsp;memory crypt&nbsp;can be activated to project the memory ghost&rsquo;s image, but the memory ghost is gone and can no longer interact, answer questions, or serve as the focus for&nbsp;@Compendium[sfrpg.spells.IRUPIVT101SvIK6l]{Raise Dead}&nbsp;or&nbsp;restoration.

You must always remain within 20 feet of the image and maintain line of sight to it, or the image winks out with a flash of static.

The hovering mimic imager operates as the helmet-mounted version, except that the hologram created by the hovering mimic imager can also mimic speech in your voice, and the DC of Perception checks to identify the hologram is 30. As the hovering mimic imager isn&rsquo;t attached to you, the image can be up to 100 feet from you and doesn&rsquo;t require line of sight to you (although it must be within 20 feet of and have line of sight to the microbot). The hovering mimic imager can receive your directions by voice or via a signal from a personal comm unit or a datapad with a control module installed. The hovering mimic imager has sound baffling and a light-shifting shell to avoid detection, but a creature can notice it with a successful DC 25 Perception check. Detecting the microbot doesn&rsquo;t automatically reveal that your duplicate is a hologram, but its presence can provide creatures a clue that something unusual is going on. The hovering mimic imager is a Tiny technological construct with an AC of 20, hardness 8, 10 Hit Points, and a fly speed of 40 feet with perfect maneuverability. It cannot make attacks, and it fails any saving throw it is required to make. When the mimic imager has only 4 charges remaining, the hologram winks out and the hovering mimic imager immediately returns to you if it can.

Researchers explored ways to further insulate the empathic race from the Swarm&rsquo;s psychic call, ranging from the ineffective to the distasteful to some outright unethical practices. The&nbsp;mindshield circlet&nbsp;is in the center of this gamut, although it has retained some utility beyond the potential it has to prevent Swarm manipulation.<br /><br />While wearing a&nbsp;mindshield circlet, you can&rsquo;t use limited telepathy and telepathy, and those using such abilities can&rsquo;t contact you. In addition, you can cast no spells and use no spell-like abilities that are mind-affecting. Furthermore, it is more difficult to affect you with such abilities, even beneficial ones. The&nbsp;mindshield circlet&rsquo;s model determines a DC, providing protection against such effects.

While active, as long as you haven&rsquo;t moved for at least 1 round, the badge emits a quick flash of red light whenever a Small or larger corporeal creature approaches within 60 feet, although creatures undetectable to normal vision (such as an invisible creature) don&rsquo;t trigger the flash. This flash is sufficient to alert you, but doesn&rsquo;t otherwise affect your vision or your actions. Reduce this distance by 20 feet for each interposing closed door or substantial barrier (such as a wall at least 1 inch thick). You can attune the badge to a creature by touching it with the item, which takes a full action; you can attune the badge to up to 10 different creatures. When you are within 60 feet of one of these creatures, regardless of whether you have moved in the past round, the badge emits a yellow flash to let you know an ally is near. Attempting to attune an eleventh creature causes the badge to lose its attunement to the earliest attuned creature.

While wearing a&nbsp;necrotic mantle, if you are undead, you have the aura of a living creature instead of an undead for the purposes of magic or technology that can detect undead. You receive a +4 divine bonus to saves against any spell or effect that targets undead, such as&nbsp;control undead. In addition, if you are undead and fail a saving throw against a spell that both affects only undead creatures and has an ongoing effect (such as&nbsp;control undead), you can attempt a second saving throw after 1 round with the same DC as the first. If you succeed, you gain the same reduction in effect as if your initial saving throw had been successful. Additionally, any effort to determine whether a&nbsp;necrotic mantle&nbsp;you are wearing is a magic or technological item requires the creature making the determination to succeed at a Will save (DC = 15 + your key ability modifier).<br /><br />If you are undead and are by or in the area of an effect that restores Hit Points only to living creatures, you regain half the number of Hit Points instead of none. If that effect also damages undead creatures, you take no damage; this does not apply to effects that harm undead without healing living creatures.</p>"

Instead, the receiver embeds into the target&rsquo;s body, injecting a small numbing agent into the target&rsquo;s bloodstream, making them unaware of the embedded receiver unless they or an adjacent ally succeeds at a Perception check (DC = the result of your attack roll to embed the receiver). Once found, the receiver can be removed with a standard action and a successful DC 30 Medicine check. The signal sent from a neuropoppet to the neural receiver can be jammed with a signal jammer.<br /><br />While the neural receiver is embedded in a living humanoid target within 60 feet, you can manipulate the neuropoppet as a full action with two hands (this uses up one of the item&rsquo;s charges), causing the receiver to send subtle electrical signals through the target&rsquo;s nervous system.

If not for conservation efforts on @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.mkJGLfpJkvAKLZz3]{Castrovel}, tashtaris could have been hunted to extinction, since their photosensitive adaptations are difficult and expensive to duplicate through synthetic means. Cessation of hostilities between the formians and lashuntas has allowed a recent surge in the regulated trade of biotech that incorporates tashtari tissue. Explorers and scouts equip themselves with focusing membranes or filament mesh, and many people throughout the Pact Worlds use photoenergetic nodes for practical and cosmetic purposes.</p>\n<h2>Focusing Membrane</h2>\n<p>Implanting a tashtari&rsquo;s photoenergetic node into your hand causes the appendage to glow with faint light. As a move action, you can discharge energy stored in your photoenergetic node into an analog melee weapon that you are currently holding in the same hand that has this biotech augmentation installed. The released energy instantaneously superheats the melee weapon, causing the weapon to deal 1d6 additional fire damage on a successful attack. The affected weapon deals this additional damage for 1 round for every 2 character levels you have. While heated, the affected weapon also sheds light as a flashlight, lantern, or beacon (you choose when you activate the augmentation). Once you&rsquo;ve expended your photoenergetic node, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you&rsquo;ve rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, but you can spend 1 Resolve Point to recharge it immediately.</p>"

With either a mental command or a programmable interface built into the hand, you can reconfigure your hand into the shape of various tools. The hand can contain programming for nine different tools, in addition to a configuration for a normal hand for your species. As a move action, you can switch the setting, causing the adamantine pieces to realign into the shape of the chosen tool. The tool has all the flexibility of the normal tool (or of a hand, if set to that).<br>Programming a new tool into the polyhand takes 10 minutes, and you must choose either to fill an empty slot or to replace a programmed tool. The tool replicated must be 8th level or lower. The polyhand can replicate the moving parts of a tool, but you must supply any fuel or batteries needed for the tool to function. The tool cannot produce substances, and since it’s not very conductive (important so as to avoid shocking the user), it can’t serve as a power conduit or data transmission line. The GM has final say in deciding which tools you can duplicate. The tools within engineering kits and similar kits can be duplicated, subject to the restrictions above.<br>You can’t replace the hand setting based on your biology, which is required for the polyhand to function properly. You can add a hand corresponding to another species in any slot that isn’t reserved; for instance, a @Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human} could program her polyhand to replicate a @Compendium[sfrpg.races.VIJ6pdOVTJle3vJx]{Shirren} hand. This can’t duplicate features of a unique individual, such as thumbprints. You can install a polyhand into a prosthetic limb that replaces an arm as if the prosthetic were a natural arm.<br>The adamantine construction makes the polyhand extremely durable (see page 408 in Chapter 11 for more information about adamantine). This doesn’t change the amount of unarmed strike damage, no matter the form your polyhand is in. The polyhand can’t maintain structural integrity if extended too far, so it can’t assume a form more than one and a half feet long in any dimension. Consequently, it can’t extend your reach.</p>"

Most are wide mesh belts with entwined serpentine patterns, though&nbsp;redundancy belts&nbsp;made beyond Arshalin have a wider variety of appearances. After being worn for at least 24 hours, the belt creates duplicates of your existing vital organs that last as long as you wear the belt, magically and temporarily rearranging your internal anatomy to create space for them. You gain a +4 resistance bonus to Fortitude saving throws against @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poison}, to withstand the harmful effects of thick and thin atmospheres, and to avoid choking when breathing in heavy smoke. You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to four times your Constitution score, and you always take minimum damage from falls (as though rolling a 1 for each die of damage).</p>"

The table both reads the creature&rsquo;s own genetic code (or equivalent data) and uses supercomputing predictive algorithms to determine what damage or affliction is present, then attempts to restore the subject to perfect health based on that information.<br /><br />A living creature using a regeneration table is affected as if a 6th-level&nbsp;mystic cure&nbsp;spell as well as the&nbsp;remove affliction&nbsp;and restoration spells were cast on it. A @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.nEJIWMKbPjqKuelo]{Dead} creature is affected as if&nbsp;@Compendium[sfrpg.spells.IRUPIVT101SvIK6l]{Raise Dead}&nbsp;were cast on it.

Originally designed by Abadarcorp during the war between the Pact Worlds and the Veskarium, replenigel is intended to provide a soldier with all of their daily nutritional needs and an added resistance to @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P]{Afflictions}, while digesting slowly enough to require a soldier to eat only once per day. To minimize packaging costs, Abadarcorp commonly shipped replenigel to the front lines in 50-pound blocks that, unappetizingly, resembled marbled sulfur. After the conflict with the Veskarium ceased, the corporation found itself with a surplus of replenigel cubes and no way to sell them. A particularly savvy marketing executive realized that subtle tweaks to the product&rsquo;s aesthetics could have a dramatic impact on its commercial viability. After extensive focus-group testing, Abadarcorp created Nutrimanders, reshaping the gelatin into sizable, 1-pound megavitamins molded to look like skittermanders and available in various artificial flavors and colors.<br /><br />It takes 5 minutes to consume a replenigel megavitamin. You gain 10 temporary Hit Points and a +2 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves against @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.GnEF27Oot3zqTaBQ]{Diseases} and @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poisons} for the next 24 hours.

Failure means you develop a waxy sheen on your skin that makes you smell vaguely like a fermented version of the flavor of megavitamin you most recently consumed. Your skin remains this way for 1d4 days, during which time you take a &ndash;4 penalty to all Charismabased skill checks; if you consume another megavitamin during this time, the duration is increased by 1 day.</p>"

For a fusion, this costs half as much as purchasing the fusion for the weapon on which it is currently installed; for a seal, this is half the cost of the seal itself. The process takes 8 hours. Afterward, a fusion can be installed on a new weapon and assigned a new owner for the installation cost, and a fusion seal can be used normally.&nbsp;</span></p>"

Unliving creatures can&rsquo;t use a&nbsp;soul projector.<br /><br />Each time you attack with a&nbsp;soul projector, it draws forth a tiny bit of your essence to power itself, and you lose a number of Hit Points equal to the number of damage dice the projector deals to your target.

When the apparatus is held over the head of a Small or Medium living creature for 1 minute, the band of energy pulsates wildly, and at the end of that time, the clasps slap down and start to painlessly burrow into the creature&rsquo;s cranium. After another full minute, the appendages become fully embedded, and the sovereign helm begins the 24-hour process of rewriting the neural pathways of the subject&rsquo;s brain. If the helm is removed at any time during this period and then placed back onto the same subject, the 24 hours begin anew. Once this process is complete, the sovereign helm grants the wearer some control over constructs with the technological subtype.<br />While a sovereign helm has a different method of installation than most augmentations, it acts as a brain system augmentation in all other ways. You can&rsquo;t wear and make use of a sovereign helm if you have preexisting brain system implantation, nor can you install a brain system implantation while a sovereign helm&rsquo;s apparatuses are burrowed into your cranium.<br />Once the sovereign helm has fully rewritten your neural pathways, it allows you to spend a standard action in an attempt to assert some amount of control over a single construct with the technological subtype that you can see within 60 feet of you. A targeted construct must attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your level + your key ability score modifier); on a failure, it must stop what is doing and can do only what you command (using only the following commands) until the end of your next turn. If the construct succeeds at its saving throw, it is immune to your sovereign helm&rsquo;s control for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Full Stop:</strong>&nbsp;The construct cannot do anything until the end of your next turn.<br /><strong>Move:&nbsp;</strong>On the construct&rsquo;s next turn, you can decide how it spends its move action.<br /><strong>Attack:</strong>&nbsp;On the construct&rsquo;s next turn, you can decide how it attacks.</p>\n<p><br />After the first round a construct has failed its save, you can attempt to maintain your control over it with a move action each round, but the construct can attempt another saving throw. If the construct succeeds, you lose control and the construct is immune to your sovereign helm&rsquo;s effects for 24 hours. If the construct fails, your control over it continues until the end of your next turn, and you can choose the same or a different command from the list.

In addition to slots for traditional armor upgrades, each suit of Aeon Guard battle dress also includes additional aeon upgrade slots that can be used to house only aeon stones. Placing an aeon stone in an aeon upgrade slot allows you to benefit from the aeon stone&rsquo;s abilities as if it was orbiting your head.

This is as much for the soldier&rsquo;s benefit as the enemy&rsquo;s, as being unable to distinguish one&rsquo;s comrades makes it easier to ignore personal attachment and remain a true tool of the throne.

			"description": "<p>This vicious-looking clawed wand is used to detect and quickly remove foreign objects from under the skin. You can use the subdermal extractor only on an unconscious or willing target. The clawed end of the subdermal extractor contains a delicate sensor that evaluates the target&rsquo;s genetic material and scans for foreign objects (including alien eggs, biotech and cybernetic augmentations, tracking chips, etc.). To detect an anomalous object, you take a move action and must succeed at a Computers or Medicine check with a DC equal to 15 or 10 + the level of the implanted item, whichever is higher. If the implanted material was injected as part of a creature&rsquo;s attack, the DC is instead 15 + the CR of the attacking creature. As a standard action, you can deploy the subdermal extractor to remove anomalous material you have detected. This typically requires a successful DC 25 Medicine check, but this DC might be lower or higher at the GM&rsquo;s discretion (such as if the item is particularly small or if it has woven itself into the target&rsquo;s interior physiology). Whether or not you succeed or fail at the check, the target takes 1d6 slashing damage from the attempt. Each detection attempt uses a charge from the subdermal extractor, as does each removal attempt. You can use a subdermal extractor on yourself, but the DCs of skill checks to use it are increased by 2.<br /><br />Although a subdermal extractor can be used to quickly remove cybernetics or other augmentations, only the most disreputable back-alley shops use subdermal extractors for this purpose, and such augmentations still can&rsquo;t be resold.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity&nbsp;</strong>20;&nbsp;<strong>Usage&nbsp;</strong>1/use</p>"

Attempting to use a&nbsp;Swarm programmer pill&nbsp;while you are @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.33ynSbmexuxC3cAQ]{Exhausted} does little other than consume the pill. While under the pill&rsquo;s effects, you attract the attention of Swarm components in the same way weapons that have the Swarm weapon special property do.<br /><br />Acidic Ejection:&nbsp;You gain acid resistance 5 and can launch acid as if part of your body (often the mouth) were a macrergate acid cannon, with which you are considered to be proficient. You are immune to your own acid. These adaptations last 4 hours.<br /><br />Alate Form:&nbsp;You grow a set of diaphanous insectile wings that allow you to fly at a speed 10 feet slower than your land speed. Your flight is an extraordinary ability with average maneuverability. The adaptation also grants you a +5 bonus to Acrobatics checks to fly. The wings function for 2 hours. If you are aloft when the effect ends, you float downward 60 feet per round for 3 rounds. If you fail to land or attain another means to fly by then, you fall as the wings detach. This detachment is uncomfortable but deals you no damage.<br /><br />If necessary, the wings can integrate with your armor. Once they have, removing your armor ends the effect by causing the wings to detach as above.<br /><br />Arolia:&nbsp;You grow special limb pads that grant you a climb speed 10 feet slower than your land speed. You retain this speed for 12 hours. If necessary, the pads can integrate with your armor, functioning as with the wings of alate form. If you&rsquo;re climbing when the effect ends, you can still attempt to climb by other means.<br /><br />Bravery:&nbsp;You become inured to fear. For 24 hours, whenever you attempt a saving throw against a @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.PqV3OCbUTyk2upPD]{Fear} effect, treat any number you roll on the d20 lower than 8 as 8.

If you still fail the saving throw, you suffer the @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.PqV3OCbUTyk2upPD]{Fear} effect for only half its duration, rounded down to a minimum of 0 rounds.<br /><br />Swiftness:&nbsp;For 12 hours, you gain a 20-foot enhancement bonus to speed in all movement types you have.<br /><br />Telepathy:&nbsp;You gain limited telepathy with a range of 30 feet, like that of a lashunta or @Compendium[sfrpg.races.VIJ6pdOVTJle3vJx]{Shirren}. If you already have limited telepathy, the adaptation grants you true telepathy. Either adaptation lasts 12 hours. During this time, you can also cast the 1st-level version of mind thrust as a spell-like ability up to three times.<br /><br />Weaponized Arm:&nbsp;One of your hands grows a macrergate mindspike or macrergate thresherblade, with which you are considered to be proficient. If necessary, the weapon integrates with your armor, functioning as with the wings of alate form.

They were first developed in @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Yt2xT4Iy6lHjCzso]{The Diaspora} to allow miners to locate veins of metal by touch through the material of their space suits. It soon found applications for thieves and explorers alike. Using the gloves, you can perceive and manipulate objects close at hand without actually touching them, and you can even sense details hidden just below the surface.<br /><br />While wearing a pair of&nbsp;tactokinesis gloves, you can use the Perception and Physical Science skills to examine a metal or technological construct or object within your reach, whether or not you can perceive the object with other senses. In addition, the gloves provide a +2 circumstance bonus to Engineering checks to assess stability or disable a device, and they count as necessary tools for such purposes. You can attempt such checks without directly touching the target, as well as use similar abilities that manipulate technology by touch, such as the overload mechanic class feature. In a zero-gravity environment, you can use the limited telekinesis provided by the gloves to pick up and move objects of up to 1 bulk without actually touching them. As a standard action, you can use the gloves to deliver a disruptive pulse to an @Compendium[sfrpg.races.GHIntVN70xTt2Tlo]{Android}, drone, robot, or creature with the technological subtype. If the creature fails a Will saving throw (DC = 13 + your Dexterity modifier), it is @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.2XWEujYSyryB4oHm]{Dazed} for 1 round. Once a creature has attempted a saving throw against this ability (regardless of the result), it is immune to this ability for 24 hours.<br /><br />The range of this telekinesis is limited to your reach, as you must be almost touching the target to manipulate it.&nbsp;Tactokinesis gloves&nbsp;do not function through a force field.</p>"

Each UPB is a tiny multifunction component, not much larger than a grain of rice, capable of being configured to act as a brace, capacitor, circuit, diode, fastener, insulator, lens, modulator, pipe, resistor, and dozens of other constituent parts. UPBs can even be spun out into fabric, broken down into component chemicals, reconstituted into new chemicals, or supplemented with base materials (such as dirt or sand) to form massive braces or walls. The right combination of hundreds or even thousands of UPBs can create everything from a comm unit to a laser weapon to powered armor. In their raw form, UPBs have a bulk of 1 per 1,000 UPBs, though when aligned and configured they can easily take up less bulk, and when configured for a specific purpose that calls for a minimum size and bracing (possibly combining them with inert materials), they can have a higher bulk.<br /><br />UPBs are so ubiquitous that they are usable as currency in many major settlements and trade hubs. While credsticks are a more convenient and secure way to carry value, UPBs have the advantage of direct utility and untraceability. They are a popular way to pay smugglers and criminals, but they are also useful for trade missions to systems with UPB technology that don&rsquo;t use credits as currency. The value of the Pact Worlds&rsquo; credit is based on the economic utility of a single UPB.</p>"

A wrist leech requires no battery, but survives for only 4 hours once placed on the skin before it shrivels up and dies.<br />Organic technological items can regain HP from effects that restore HP, such as a&nbsp;mystic cure&nbsp;spell, and they regain a number of HP equal to their item level each day.</p>"
